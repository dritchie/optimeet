# Optimeet: Schedule ALL the meetings

Optimeet is a tool for coordinated scheduling of multiple meetings. Existing meeting scheduling tools (e.g. Doodle, when2meet, Calendly) poll participants for availability and help everyone find a time that works, but they only do this for a **single** meeting. In contrast, Optimeet gathers availability for **multiple** meetings (which may have overlapping sets of participants) and visualizes this information in a convenient interface that allows rapid exploration of different viable ways to schedule all meetings.

## Installation
Optimeet is easy to install; just run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

from the repository root directory. In fact, Optimeet only has one external dependency (the Python [schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

## Contact
Optimeet was created by me, [Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io), professor of Computer Science at Brown University, for scheduling weekly meetings with members of my research group every semester. If you find Optimeet useful, please do send me [email](mailto:daniel_ritchie@brown.edu)! I'm especially interested in hearing about use cases outside of academia. If you find a bug or make a modificaton to Optimeet that you think might be useful to others, I'm happy to review pull requests. I am open to hearing feature requests, but I can't promise I'll have time to work on new features any time soon.
