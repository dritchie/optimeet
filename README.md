Optimeet was created by me, [Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io), professor of Computer Science at Brown University, for scheduling weekly meetings with members of my research group every semester. If you find Optimeet useful, please do send me [email](mailto:daniel_ritchie@brown.edu)! I'm especially interested in hearing about use cases outside of academia. If you find a bug or make a modificaton to Optimeet that you think might be useful to others, I'm happy to review pull requests. I am open to hearing feature requests, but I can't promise I'll have time to work on new features any time soon.
